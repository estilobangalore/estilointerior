# How to Add Your Logo to Beautiful Interiors Website

## Quick Guide

1. **Prepare your logo file**:
   - Make sure your logo is saved as a PNG file with transparent background (if possible)
   - Rename your logo file to `logo.png`

2. **Place your logo in the correct location**:
   - Copy your `logo.png` file to this directory (`client/public/images/`)
   - If you're using an FTP client or file manager, upload to this location

3. **Refresh your website**:
   - After adding the logo, refresh your browser to see the changes
   - The logo will automatically appear in the navigation bar

## Troubleshooting

If your logo doesn't appear or looks incorrect:

- **Size issues**: If your logo appears too large or too small, you can adjust the height in the Navigation.tsx file (look for `className="relative h-12 w-auto"` and change `h-12` to a different value)
- **Format issues**: Make sure your file is actually a PNG file with the .png extension
- **File name**: Ensure the file is named exactly `logo.png` (case sensitive)
- **Cache issues**: Try a hard refresh (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R) to clear your browser cache

## Need More Help?

If you need to make more advanced customizations to your logo display, you can modify the Navigation.tsx file directly. Look for the Logo component section.
